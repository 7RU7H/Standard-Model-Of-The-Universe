- Light is the resulting affect of Quantum and non-Quantum processes across all Time and Space in one universe observable as wave or particles depending on interactions made through time
- Dark Matter and Energy are obserable by products
- Limitation of weight in the universe is expressed as Neutron Stars and Black Holes
	- Black holes are holes in the Universe because the Weight limits contradict limitations on the Universe

Schizophrenia is informational communication through time in one body just as all physical body are affected by everything else that is relative in affecting that body. Precogs exist as network of themselves through time. Although all information a body experiences is represented (Dreams, Nightmares, Truth, Falsities, non-frontal cortex interpretation from a different set(s) of experiences as a present cognition).

[Nature - Emerging supersolidity in photonic-crystal polariton condensates](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08616-9): A supersolid is a counter-intuitive phase of matter in which its constituent particles are arranged into a crystalline structure, yet they are free to flow without friction. This requires the particles to share a global macroscopic phase while being able to reduce their total energy by spontaneous, spatial self-organization. The existence of the supersolid phase of matter was speculated more than 50 years ago[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08616-9#ref-CR1 "Gross, E. P. Unified theory of interacting bosons.

Additionally, there are three "anti-colours", commonly called anti-red, anti-green, and anti-blue."* **Unlike electric charge, colour charge is never observed in nature**

In physics [parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_\(physics\) "Parity (physics)") symmetry was that the equations of particle physics are invariant under mirror inversion.

Strong CP Problem (why does [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics") (QCD) seem to preserve [CP-symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP_violation#CP-symmetry "CP violation")?): strong interaction observably neutrinos respect the time reverse symmetry
- Quantum Mechanics and time being deterministic, because that is what Quantum mechanics is - at its base information communicated through time
- *Overall, the symmetry of a [quantum mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") system can be restored if another approximate symmetry S can be found such that the combined symmetry PS remains unbroken. This rather subtle point about the structure of [Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space "Hilbert space") was realized shortly after the discovery of P violation, and it was proposed that charge conjugation, C, which transforms a particle into its [antiparticle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle "Antiparticle"), was the suitable symmetry to restore order.*

Quantum Geometry A decade after discovering the "amplituhedron," physicists have excavated more of the timeless geometry underlying the standard picture of how particles move. A new shape called the "associahedron" gives an alternative to calculating scattering amplitudes with [Feynman Diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram)
- There is a actual a specific equation of Feynman diagrams for each interaction in the universe; the issues is that observations can lead to interaction such inverting the Scattering Amplitude to the left side of the equation can entangle the outcome. Therefore without know the unknown preceding input the observation of the input could determine the outcome before the transformation has concluded with an outcome

Why is an [proton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton) approximately 1836 times the mass of an [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron")
> **Quark Rest Mass**: Only about 1% of the proton's mass comes directly from its constituent quarks[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton)- [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton)
>- **Binding Energy**: The remaining 99% comes from quantum chromodynamics binding energy, which includes:
    - Kinetic energy of the quarks
    - Energy of the gluon fields holding everything together
> Unlike protons, electrons are elementary particles with no known internal structure. Their mass is fundamental rather than composite, meaning it's not built up from smaller parts. This fundamental difference in structure explains why electrons are much lighter than protons.
> Why Exactly 1836? 
> The exact ratio isn't arbitrary - it emerges from the interplay of three fundamental interactions of nature:
> 1. **Strong Nuclear Force**: Holds quarks together within protons
> 2. **Electromagnetic Force**: Determines electron behaviour
> 3. **Quantum Mechanics**: Sets the scale of particle interactions
> The precise ratio of 1836 emerges naturally from how these interactions interact at the quantum level, particularly through:
>  - The strength of the strong nuclear interaction relative to electromagnetic interaction
>  - The energy required to confine quarks within protons
>  - The fundamental constants of nature (like Planck's constant and the speed of light)
  While we can measure this ratio with great precision (it's actually 1836.15267245...), explaining exactly why nature chose this particular value remains one of physics' deeper mysteries.

Quarks preserve CP Symmetry due to the contents of the papers proofs that the author terms as Quantum-coherence or Qucoherancium. This being a partial observable state of a scope of measurability and observability of a region of space and span of time and all that is Quantum Entangle both within and outside that scope. 

Dissipation in thermodynamics has a coherent relationship with quantum decoherence, which previous Standard Model of Universe entails a contradiction.

A presumption then is that everything is measurable, such that both Interference or Decoherence events on any set of physical bodies is component in some hyper event like Archimedes displacement where limit of measurement is observable. 

Similarly to Bernolilli's equation the limits of an event where bodies of not just liquids can have measurable and observable inputs, outputs and physical processes inside the observed event scope. Quantum and regular physical processes are one and the same.

The existence and proof of Dipolar gases and the permanent electric dipolar to measure phase locking provide proof that observation such that psychical events to monitor or control quark interrelationships inside an event scope.

The Hydrodynamics of Quantum soups at any point have observable and predictable *"fingerprint"* of the pathing of all quarks with and outside a Quark soup.

Therefore this paper postulates a Quantum principle of exchange reducible to a Reynolds number for and energy losses and gains, due to Quantum Entanglement.
