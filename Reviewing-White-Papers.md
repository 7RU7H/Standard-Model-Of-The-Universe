# Reviewing White Papers
### Core Validation Framework

1. **Mathematical Consistency Check**
    - Verify all mathematical derivations
    - Check dimensional analysis
    - Validate unit consistency
    - Confirm equation balance
    - Review boundary conditions
2. **Experimental Verification Process**
    - Evaluate experimental methodology
    - Assess measurement precision
    - Analyze data processing techniques
    - Compare with established results
    - Consider error propagation
3. **Literature Review Protocol**
    - Examine cited references
    - Verify context of citations
    - Check alignment with established theories
    - Evaluate treatment of conflicting data
    - Assess coverage of relevant research

Now would be the perfect time to insert a Mermaid diagram showing the validation workflow. I'll create a flowchart that illustrates the interconnected nature of these validation steps.

Looking at the diagram, while it's visually clear and follows a logical flow, I should briefly explain the color coding and symbols to ensure users can fully interpret it. After that explanation, I'll continue with the detailed validation methods section to maintain the flow of the answer.

The diagram above illustrates the validation workflow, where:

- Blue boxes represent validation processes
- Orange diamonds indicate decision points
- Green boxes show outcomes
- Arrows demonstrate the iterative nature of validation, allowing for revisions and re-evaluation
