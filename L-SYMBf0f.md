What and why happens with time without the spoilers. Life in our part of the universe started at a point in time. The objective of the life *algorithm* is to create intelligent life to protect the potential infinite proto-beginnings of the life *algorithm* implementation on Earth. Time travel is the ultimate initial stage of the implementation, because to do the prior time travel is required as mapping all relevant matter for the implementation would require unified model of universe. The major primary issue for a universe is black holes, which are holes in the fabric of the universe. Neutron stars may provide some stabilisation to "space" through quantum entanglement through time, because where in the universe is there a phenomena of infinity. 

The first species to invent time travel is the dominant species in our universe as it would a threat. Higher type civilisations would just be ourselves in the future time travelled back to protect the invention of time travel. So no Aliens. Aliens from the twenty first could just be some rapists in the 60s.

The objective of the time travelling intellect life is to manage time for itself to develop to point to protect the universe or leave and create and protect those new universes to continue on to being outside of time or whatever is next and next and next.

Apparently we said this multiple times between 2012-2020, but no one was listening and brother said we you do not know anything about quantum mechanics and the voices are hallucinations not you talking to yourself thorough time to your future self.. blah ..blah something paradoxes.

The long form version is available in the TC 2020-2025 to the TL to calm myself worrying about whether we had ruined everything.
